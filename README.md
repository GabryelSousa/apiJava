## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Starting #

To start the application and use it, you'll have to perform some configurations first.

1 - Using Docker () upload the server already configured, using the image located in the file: docker-compose.yaml

2 - Submit a request to the PotterAPI API to obtain an access key:

Method: POST
Host: http://us-central1-rh-challenges.cloudfunctions.net/potterApi/users
Body: {
"email": "YOUR_EMAIL_HERE",
"password": "SET_A_PASSWORD_HERE",
"name": "YOUR_NAME_HERE"
}

The callback will be your created user, following the following model:

{
   "user": {
     "email": "email",
     "password": "your encrypted password",
     "id": "id",
     "apiKey": "your apikey",
     "name": "name"
   }
}
Save your apiKey in a safe place, it will be used to communicate with the API.


After getting your APIKEY, inside the file: application.properties, define your API in the field: "api_key".

After that, just upload the application and perform the tests!
